Welcome to the first release of the Incapable Mod, version 1.0.0! This initial release introduces a fundamental gameplay mechanic designed to enhance your Minecraft experience by adding a touch of realism and challenge. Here’s what you need to know:

### Core Mechanic: Tool Dependency

In this release, the core feature of Incapable Mod is now live: **Tool Dependency**. In the world of Minecraft, you’ll now find that breaking blocks is no longer a simple task. The mod enforces that:

- **Proper Tools Required:** You can no longer mine or break blocks unless you are using the appropriate tool for the job. Want to chop down trees? You’ll need an axe. Dig through stone? Grab a pickaxe. Your hands, unfortunately, are no longer sufficient for these tasks.

- **Realistic Challenge:** Just like in real life, attempting to mine blocks with your bare hands will result in inefficiency and even damage. This mechanic aims to add a layer of realism and make your tool choices more strategic.

### What’s Included in 1.0.0

- **Basic Tool Enforcement:** The mod will prevent block breaking unless the correct tool is equipped. This includes logs, ores, and other key block types.
- **Damage Prevention:** Attempting to break blocks with incorrect tools (or no tools) will now cause minor damage to your character, reinforcing the need for proper equipment.
- **Simple Integration:** The mod integrates seamlessly with Minecraft, making it easy to get started without additional setup.

### Future Plans

This is just the beginning for Incapable Mod. Future updates will expand upon this core mechanic with additional features and improvements based on player feedback and testing.

We hope you enjoy this new challenge and find the added depth to gameplay both engaging and rewarding. Thank you for being part of the journey with Incapable Mod!

**Stay tuned for future updates, and as always, happy mining (with the right tools)!**
